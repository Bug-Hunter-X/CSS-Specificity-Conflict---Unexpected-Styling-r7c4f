The solution involves understanding and managing CSS specificity. Here are two approaches:

**1. Increasing the specificity of the intended style:**
In this case, we can make the `.container p` selector more specific:
```css
.container p {
  color: blue;
}
```
This ensures that the `color: blue;` style is applied to the paragraph within the container.

**2. Using the `!important` flag (use sparingly):**
Though generally discouraged, the `!important` flag can override any specificity conflict. However, overuse can lead to maintainability issues.
```css
.container {
  color: blue !important;
}
```
This will force the blue color, but it's a less clean solution and should be avoided if possible.
