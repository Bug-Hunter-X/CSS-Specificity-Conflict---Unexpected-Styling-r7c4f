The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where specificity conflicts can lead to unexpected styling behavior.  The problem stems from the fact that both the `.container` and `p` selectors apply to the paragraph element, resulting in a conflict over the `color` property. Due to the specificity rules in CSS, the more specific selector (the `p` selector in this case) will override the other selector. This may lead to unexpected behavior if the developer intended the `color` property of the paragraph to be blue instead of red.
